Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Testability Smell,Cause of the Smell
trello-backend,com0.trello.Board.controller,BoardController,Hard-wired Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class creates objects of concrete classes and uses them. Following concrete classes are instantiated and used: com0.trello.Board.model.Board
trello-backend,com0.trello.Board.service,BoardService,Law of Demeter violation,The tool detected the smell in this method (getAllBoardsInWorkspace) because the method voilates the law of Demeter. The long chain of method invocations is : com0.trello.WorkSpace.model.WorkSpace.getId; com0.trello.Board.model.Board.getWorkSpace
trello-backend,com0.trello,BoardTest,Hard-wired Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class creates objects of concrete classes and uses them. Following concrete classes are instantiated and used: com0.trello.WorkSpace.model.WorkSpace; com0.trello.Board.model.Board
trello-backend,com0.trello,TaskTest,Hard-wired Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class creates objects of concrete classes and uses them. Following concrete classes are instantiated and used: com0.trello.Task.model.Task; com0.trello.WorkSpace.model.WorkSpace; com0.trello.User.model.User; com0.trello.Board.model.Board
trello-backend,com0.trello,TaskTest,Excessive Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class depends on too many dependencies. The total number of dependencies is: 8
